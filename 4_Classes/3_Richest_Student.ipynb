    "### Background & Objectives\n",
    "Suppose you have students (defined by the class `Student`) who each have an amount of money (in bills of five, ten and twenty euro). We want to be able to compare them based on their wealth. Letâ€™s create a class `Student` which will store all their information and help with comparing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specs\n",
    "- When initializing a `Student`, require 4 additional arguments: the studentâ€™s name and the number of bills they own (`fives`, `tens`, and `twenties`).\n",
    "- Implement a `wealth` method on `Student`. When called, it should return the total wealth of the student.\n",
    "- Implement a `compare` method which takes one argument, another student, and returns the name of the richer student.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional\n",
    "- Implement an `advanced_compare` method which takes one argument, a list of students. When called, it should return a list of all the studentsâ€™ names sorted from most wealthy to least wealthy â€” donâ€™t forget to include the student instance the method was called on in the sort ðŸ˜‰\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: A stable key-based sort or custom comparator pattern can help here.\n",
