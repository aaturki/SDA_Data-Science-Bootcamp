    "Thanks to Pythonâ€™s built-in `random` library we have access to a `shuffle` method, which when called on a list returns a shuffled version of that list. In this advanced exercise, letâ€™s try to code a shuffle function ourselves from scratch.\n",

    "## Specs\n",
    "Code a `manual_shuffle` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function should take one argument, a list, and return a new list with all the items of your original list in a new, randomized order.\n",
    "- Do NOT use any built-in list methods to manipulate the order such as `sort()`.\n",
    "- Do NOT use the built-in `shuffle` method in Pythonâ€™s `random` library (letâ€™s do it the hard way). But you might find some other helpful methods in there; we imported the `random` library for you at the top of the file ðŸ˜‰\n",
    "- Hint: You should not make changes to the original list. The `copy` method will come in handy. One approach could be to create a new empty array B, and until A is empty, randomly select an index in A, append the element in A at that index into B, then delete that index in A. Proceed until A is empty. B should contain the new shuffled array!\n",
